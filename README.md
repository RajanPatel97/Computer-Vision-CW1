# Randomized-Decision-Forests-for-Image-Categorisation
We present an exploration into image categorisation, by comparing the effectiveness of both Randomized Decision Forests and k-Means clustering in constructing a vocabulary of visual codewords (codebook). The subsequent Bag-of-(Visual)-Words (BoVW) representations of images are used as feature vectors, where the implementation of Random Forests for classification purposes are also considered. We endeavour to find an optimal approach that maximizes the classification accuracy, whilst taking into consideration computational complexity.
